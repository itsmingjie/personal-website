      <!-- <h1>Hi, I'm Megan</h1> -->
      <p>My name is Megan Cui.</p>
      <!-- <img id="megan" src="images/profpic.jpg"/> -->
      <p>I'm a senior at William Mason High School in suburban Cincinnati, OH and an incoming freshman at Harvard University. I plan on pursuing economics, computer science, and philosophy while I'm there. As a career, I'd like to go into developing legal technology or IP/patent law.</p>
      <p>
        I've done a lot of work when it comes to technology exposure and leadership in my community because I encountered tech by chance through attending a local hackathon my sophomore year. So, I give back by running hackathons with some of my best friends from Hack Club and <a href="https://masonhackclub.com">Mason Hack Club</a>.

        My experience as a young girl interested tech from the Midwest has given me unique insight on barriers to entry in the tech industry, and, along with <a href="https://inverse.com/article/47485-young-innovators-megan-cui-hackathon">media</a> coverage, I've been invited to speak about it at NetJets, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxtZvyCA1DE">TEDxMasonHighSchool</a>, TechOlympics, and comSpark in front of audiences of students, educators, and corporate executives alike.
      </p>
      <p>At heart, I'm also a social activist, leading change in mental health awareness and cultural diversity. I've even <a href="https://youtu.be/M1YlnqRGmmw">spoken</a> about it.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I like petting my cat, Geno, blogging, browsing r/aww, and debating.</p>
